# Install WordPress With Docker Compose

## Getting Started

WordPress is a free and open-source Content Management System (CMS) built on a MySQL database with PHP processing. By using tools like Docker and Docker Compose, you can simplify the process of setting up your preferred stack and installing WordPress. Instead of installing individual components by hand, you can use images, which standardize things like libraries, configuration files, and environment variables, and run these images in containers, isolated processes that run on a shared operating system. Additionally, by using Compose, you can coordinate multiple containers — for example, an application and database — to communicate with one another.

### Prerequisites
